        <h1>The Worst Crime in the World</h1>
        
        <p>Circumcision is the worst crime ever normalized.</p>
        
        <p>Right after leaving the safest place you'll ever know—your mother's womb—you get strapped down.</p>
        
        <p>A blade cuts through your most pleasurable body part for 10–20 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>You scream until your eyes bleed and your lungs collapse from exhaustion.</p>
        
        <p>The doctor swore "first, do no harm" while doing exactly that.</p>
        
        <p>Your parents maybe didn't know.</p>
        
        <p>They were told it was safer, cleaner, or required by God.</p>
        
        <p>They trusted the system.</p>
        
        <p>They possibly handed you over thinking they were protecting you.</p>
        
        <p>They'll never be told the foreskin wasn't "extra skin"—it was almost all the sensitive tissue you were supposed to have for life.</p>
        
        <p>You won't know what slow, deep, effortless sex feels like.</p>
        
        <p>Sex will take more work, more lube, less feeling.</p>
        
        <p>You'll wonder why it feels like something's missing and be told "that's normal."</p>
        
        <p>You might feel jealous of women, angry at your own body, and feel conflicted for feeling that way.</p>
        
        <p>You'll possibly cope for life.</p>
        
        <p>And if you ever speak up, people will laugh and say "get over it, you were just a baby."</p>
        
        <p>But it was a crime.</p>
        
        <p>One day this will be seen like bloodletting or lobotomies—something we can't believe we ever did to babies.</p>
        
        <p>If you're reading this and you're cut, your pain is real.</p>
        
        <p>If you're reading this and you're a parent who chose accidentally it, please apologize and ask for forgiveness.</p>
