    <h1>The Worst Crime in the World

Circumcision is the worst crime ever normalized.

Right after leaving the safest place you'll ever know—your mother's womb—you get strapped down.

A blade cuts through your most pleasurable body part for 10–20 minutes.

You scream until your eyes bleed and your lungs collapse from exhaustion.
The doctor swore "first, do no harm" 

while doing exactly that.

Your parents maybe didn't know.

They were told it was safer, cleaner, or required by God.

They trusted the system.

They possibly handed you over thinking they were protecting you.

They'll never be told the foreskin wasn't "extra skin"—it was almost all the sensitive tissue you were supposed to have for life.

You won't know what slow, deep, effortless sex feels like.

Sex will take more work, more lube, less feeling.

You'll wonder why it feels like something's missing and be told "that's normal."

You might feel jealous of women, angry at your own body, and feel conflicted for feeling that way.

You'll possibly cope for life.

And if you ever speak up, people will laugh and say "get over it, you were just a baby."

But it was a crime.

One day this will be seen like bloodletting or lobotomies—something we can't believe we ever did to babies.

If you're reading this and you're cut, your pain is real.

If you're reading this and you're a parent who chose accidentally it, please apologize and ask for forgiveness
